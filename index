== About me
I am a first year PhD in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Texas at Austin. I am fortunate to be advised by [http://users.ece.utexas.edu/~sanghavi/ Prof. Sujay Sanghavi]. My research interests include theoritical machine learning, optimization, and sequential decision making under uncertainty.

Before moving to Austin, I received the B.E. degree in the Department of Electrical Engineering from [http://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/publish/thu2018en/index.html Tsinghua University] in 2018. You can refer to my [CV_ShuoYANG.pdf cv] for more detailed education and research experience.
