== About me
I am a fourth-year Ph.D. student in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Texas at Austin. I am fortunate to be advised by [http://users.ece.utexas.edu/~sanghavi/ Prof. Sujay Sanghavi] and [https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/inderjit/index.shtml Prof. Inderjit Dhillon]. My research interests include theoretical machine learning, optimization, and sequential decision making under uncertainty.

Before moving to Austin, I received a B.E. degree in the Department of Electrical Engineering from [http://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/publish/thu2018en/index.html Tsinghua University] in 2018. I also spent a great summer at the University of Alberta in 2017, working on reinforcement learning with [http://incompleteideas.net Prof. Richard Sutton]. In Spring 2017, I was an exchange student at the University of Texas at Austin, and working as an intern in [https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~pstone/ Prof. Peter Stone]'s research group. You can refer to my [CV_ShuoYANG.pdf CV] for more detailed education and research experience.
